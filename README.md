### A Tutorial of Distributed PyTorch

This highlights the use of the PyTorch DistributedDataParallel library and is expected to supplement https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html 

Reasons for the poor convergence of a small network/model (three layers)   are highlighted in https://github.com/mli/mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification#speed
